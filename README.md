# Bank Account Management Program
### This C++ program simulates a simple bank account management system. It demonstrates the use of exceptions, smart pointers, and error handling while performing basic operations like deposit, withdrawal, and account closure.

## Features:
### Deposit: Allows users to deposit money into their account. Negative deposits are not allowed and will throw an exception.

### Withdraw: Allows users to withdraw money from their account. Overdrawing the account will trigger an exception.

### Close Account: Once the account is closed, no further transactions can be made, and any attempts will result in an exception.

### Error Handling: The program uses custom exception classes to handle specific errors (negative deposit, insufficient funds, closed account).
